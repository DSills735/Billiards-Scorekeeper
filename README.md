This is a scorekeeper for 2 players to play a billiards game known as straight pool (Also referred to as 14.1 Pool). 

Straight pool has a scoring system in which any ball can be worth whatever the two players agree to. You play to a maximum score (Often 150, and each ball is worth their numerical value). 
The intention of this was to help me and a friend score the game. This will be periodically adjusted as needed. 
The intended use of this application is for people to score straight pool. This is not a teacher, simply a scoreboard. The rules of the game need to be known prior to playing. 

An example of the rules can be found here: https://www.cuesight.com/wpa/14-1-straight-pool-rules/
